# Project STEM
Once a simple teaching tool; eventually turned into a feature packed school system for Administrators, students and parents/staff. This was created so family members with kids who werenâ€™t going to school due to COVID, could create curriculums based on projected classes. The goal was to create a unique system that focuses on STEM learning. This system will allow for :  

- User authentication for core groups. Admin, staff and students 
- Calendar views for leave, attendance, and course dates 
- Notification system 
- Curriculum system to create, edit, update and delete courses 
- Reports for all core groups specific to their needs. Teachers see attendance, students see grade reports etc.

More features will be added as I gain feedback from educators on what works and doesnt.
