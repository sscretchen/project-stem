# Project STEM
What started as a means to help family members with kids who werenâ€™t going to school due to COVID; eventually turned into a fully functional school system for teachers, students and parents. The goal was to create a unique system that focuses on STEM learning. This system will allow for :  - User authentication for core groups. Admin, staff and students - Calendar views for leave, attendance, and course dates - Notification system - Curriculum system to create, edit, update and delete courses - Reports for all core groups specific to their needs. Teachers see attendance, students see grade reports etc.
