# Project STEM
What started as a simple teaching tool so family members with kids who werenâ€™t going to school due to COVID could create curriculums based on projected classes; eventually turned into a fully functional school system for teachers, students and parents/staff. The goal was to create a unique system that focuses on STEM learning.  This system will allow for :  

- User authentication for core groups. Admin, staff and students 
- Calendar views for leave, attendance, and course dates 
- Notification system 
- Curriculum system to create, edit, update and delete courses 
- Reports for all core groups specific to their needs. Teachers see attendance, students see grade reports etc.

More features will be added as I gain feedback from educators on what works and doesnt.
